Here is a complete `README.md` for your **PyTorch-based GAN Music Generator** project, tailored to your setup and compatible with **Python 3.13**:

# 🎶 AI Music Generator with PyTorch (Python 3.13 Compatible)

This project implements a simple AI-based music generator using **PyTorch** and your own **MIDI files**. It simulates a GAN-like architecture to generate new music sequences based on patterns learned from BTS MIDI songs.

## 📁 Folder Structure

```

music\_gan/
├── music\_generator.py       # Main training and generation script
├── midi\_songs/              # Folder containing input MIDI files
│   ├── BTSDynamite.mid
│   └── BTSIdol.mid
├── gan\_output.mid           # Output file (generated after training)

## ✅ Features

- Trains a basic Generator neural network with PyTorch
- Extracts melodies from real MIDI files
- Generates new music sequences as `.mid` file
- Fully compatible with **Python 3.13**
- Minimal dependencies and simple architecture

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

Install required packages using pip (all support Python 3.13):

```bash
pip install torch numpy mido pretty_midi
````

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Place your MIDI files into the `midi_songs/` folder.
3. Run the music generator:

```bash
python music_generator.py
```

4. After training, the generated music will be saved as:

```
gan_output.mid
```

You can open the `.mid` file using any MIDI player or DAW (Digital Audio Workstation).

## 🧠 Architecture

This project simulates a **GAN-like setup** using only the **Generator** component:

* Generator: A simple feedforward neural network that transforms random noise into a sequence of MIDI note pitches.

> Discriminator is skipped for simplicity, to maintain compatibility and reduce complexity in Python 3.13.

---

## 🎼 MIDI File Notes

* MIDI files must be **melody-based**, not full orchestral mixes.
* Each file is truncated to 100 notes for consistent input shape.
* Supports multiple input files for better pattern learning.

---

## 📦 Output

The script saves the generated music as a MIDI file:
